# Lego Builder

For this project we needed to access a database of lego body parts and display them. The user shouuld then be able to select new parts or randomize them and save the characters if they choose. I opted to do both selcetion and randomziation.

This assignment is inspired in part by [this pretty nifty book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDnDrO7neUE) ðŸ“–
